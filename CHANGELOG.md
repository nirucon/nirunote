# Changelog

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-08

- Based on 0.3.11, retaining editor and Preview features.
- Hunspell batch checks run in a background worker; cached results update highlighting on the Qt thread.
- Save As restores the original document path/title on failed save.
- Installer retains the previous same-version release as `.previous` rather than silently deleting it.
- Added GitHub publication script, MIT license, ignore rules, release documentation and CI.
- Preview scrolling remains a mandatory on-device release verification; no claim of a GUI fix without testing.
